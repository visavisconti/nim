### _‚ÄúCommons are defined by the existence of a shared property, in the form of a shared natural or social wealth‚Äîlands, waters, forests, systems of knowledge, capacities for care‚Äîto be used by all commoners, without any distinction.‚Äù_

**\- Silvia Federici, _Re-enchanting the world. Feminism and the Politics of the Commons_, 2018**

Unsurprisingly, if you ask someone who has recently been uprooted what they miss the most, they might say: their garden. Historically land has been a place of social nutrition, represented on a smaller scale by gardens, and have served to sustain the meaning of labour and culture making.

In the same way that primitive accumulation, or the first phase of capitalism, had enclosed land and dispossessed practitioners from their own soil, the urban landscape has eliminated any place for diversity, commonality or alternative value production.

Whilst contemporary consumerism replaced the nourishment given by communitarian endeavours and turned solidarity in a personal mission, few‚Äìso to say‚Äìcourageous citizens (David Harvey, for one), in coalization, started to question what kind of population is produced by metropolitan architecture and which practices can be restored in order to foster a lost sense of community.

In their becoming-world, they have opened the static notion of resistance to the vivid urgency and currency of organizing alternatives, by conjoining people and creating spaces where subjectivity can be collectively made.

We have listed a few of the many examples in Berlin that share this lively inclination, which through the connection between the very first human bond, the soil and its product: food, move toward the horizon of the commons.

## _**NETZWERK URBANE G√ÑRTEN BERLIN**_

_Netzwerk Urbane G√§rten Berlin_ is a grassroots network founded in summer 2017, after the community garden Prachttomate in Neuk√∂lln‚Äìamong the many threatened by similar reasons‚Äìlost part of its space due to a building project.

Since then, the network has organized and amplified the voices of many community gardens in Berlin which resist waves of gentrification, privatization and lack of social infrastructures.

The network not only wants to enable communication, exchange and sharing of garden-knowledge, but aims to build a solidaric connection between the very different community gardens in Berlin.

These are not recreational green oases to escape to, but fragments of an alternative way of living, growing from collective making.
